                <div class="Bio">
                    <p>In my personal life I am a husband, dog dad, avid sports fan, and gamer. 
                        <br><br>I've been a Jacksonville Jaguars fan since the franchise inception in 1996 and I was only two years old! I still remember having my first jersey in 1998 when they unveiled black jerseys and going to my first game with my dad. Fall Saturdays also wouldn't be the same if I wasn't cheering on my alma mater, Go 'Noles! I owe a debt of gratitude to Florida State University for my degree, lifelong friends, and most importantly my wife, Danielle. We met earlier in life as she was a sophomore during her undergrad and I a junior. Almost 8 years after meeting we've moved states, adopted a dog, gotten engaged, and most recently tied the knot. 
                        <br><br>Since mid-2019 I've been attached at the hip to an 85lb white Siberian Husky. His name is Quill, aptly named after the leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy, and he has brought more joy into my life than I ever could have imagined. When he's not lying next to me as I work [and as he is right this second], we're going on long walks and letting loose 'zoomies' in the back yard. <br><br>I've been a pretty big gamer for most of my life, though as I've gotten older there is always less and less time available to set aside. Nowadays it's a great way for me to still interact and stay in touch with old friends who live in other areas of the country, and it's helped to bridge some of that distance.</p>
